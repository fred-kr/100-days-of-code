# *100 days of code*

This repo serves two purposes: Keep track of my course progress, and get more familiar with using
git in my projects.

This `README` contains an overview of the completed projects, as well as notes on things that i
thought might be important. The projects start with day 16; the projects before that are on
[replit](https://replit.com/).

Each folder contains an isolated project with it's own `.venv`.

## Day 16 - Intro to OOP
